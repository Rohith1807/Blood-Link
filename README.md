# ü©∏Blood-Linkü©∏
### üìô**Overview**
This project is built using Python's **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface (GUI) and **SQLite** for the database. The platform allows users to:
1. **Register as blood donors** by providing personal and medical information.
2. **Request blood** by specifying the required blood type, quantity, and urgency.
3. **Manage blood stock** and track blood requests.
4. **View donor details**, blood stock levels, and blood request history.

The platform is designed to streamline the process of blood donation and requests, ensuring efficient management of blood resources.

     - `name` (Text)
     - `dob` (Text, Date of Birth in `YYYY-MM-DD` format)
     - `blood_type` (Text)
     - `contact` (Text)

2. **`blood_stock` Table**:
   - Tracks the available quantity of each blood type.
   - Columns:
     - `blood_type` (Primary Key)
     - `quantity` (Integer)

3. **`blood_requests` Table**:
   - Stores details of blood requests.
   - Columns:
     - `request_id` (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
     - `requestor_name` (Text)
     - `contact_number` (Text)
     - `email_address` (Text)
     - `blood_type_required` (Text)
     - `quantity_needed` (Integer)
     - `urgency` (Text)

### üõ†Ô∏è**Functionality Details**
1. **Donor Registration**:
   - Users can fill out a detailed donor registration form.
   - The form includes fields for personal information, medical history, and emergency contact details.
   - **Donor eligibility is validated based on age, medical history, and consent.**

2. **Blood Request Submission**:
   - Users can submit blood requests by specifying the required blood type, quantity, and urgency.
   - The system **checks the availability** of the requested blood type in the `blood_stock` table.
   - If sufficient stock is available, the request is marked as **"Fulfilled,"** and the stock is updated. Otherwise, the request is marked as **"Pending."**

3. **Data Display**:
   - **Users can view:**
     - A list of registered donors.
     - Current blood stock levels.
     - Detailed information about blood requests.

4. **Form Validation**:
   - Ensures that **all mandatory fields are filled.**
   - **Validates date formats, phone numbers, and email addresses.**
   - **Prevents future dates from being entered** for date of birth and last donation date.
